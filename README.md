# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)
DUE Friday, March 11, 2016

#Part 1: Get github
If you don't have a github account, go get one. https://github.com/
This whole assignment will be done and submitted via github, and you're already here!
 
#Part 2: Try a Library
In this exercise, you will play with at least one library provided by the Racket developers. You will have the opportunity to explore another library later.

Please choose libraries that you think you might be interested in using in your final project.

Start off at the Racket home page, http://racket-lang.org/, and then click on the Documentation link, taking you here: http://docs.racket-lang.org/.
 
There are lots of libraries. Play with one.
 
Your job is to explore one library and write up your results. Load the library and write some code to drive it around.
For example, maybe you are interested in retrieving data from the web. If we look at the net/url library, we will find functions for creating URLs, issuing HTTP GET commands, and displaying the results. Here is a little bit of code for driving around a few of the functions in this library:
```racket
#lang racket

(require net/url)

(define myurl (string->url "http://www.cs.uml.edu/"))
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))
(display-pure-port myport)
```
Notice that `(require net/url)` is all you need to put in your buffer in order to load the library and start using it.
This above is a trivial example; to complete this for the purposes of this assignment (if you go down the path of pulling HTTP requests), you should use the parsing libraries to parse the HTML, JSON, or XML that is returned.

### The following libraries are not allowed for project explorations:
* games/cards
* racket/gui
* racket/draw 

You can still use these in your project, but you must explore different libraries for this assignment.

#Part 3: Write your Report
Write your report right in this file. Instructions are below. Delete the instructions when you are done. Also delete all my explanation (this stuff), as I've already read it.

You are allowed to change/delete anything in this file to make it into your report. It will be public, FYI.

This file is formatted with the [**markdown** language][markdown], so take a glance at how that works.

This file IS your report for the assignment, including code and your story.

Code is super easy in markdown, which you can easily do inline `(require net/url)` or do in whole blocks:
```
#lang racket

(require net/url)

(define myurl (string->url "http://www.cs.uml.edu/"))
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))
(display-pure-port myport)
```

My Library: net/url

My name: Yusuf Yildiz

For this exploration I created a scraper for Fred's blog page. The scraper grabs the latest blog post and saves it locally to the users local folder as "latest-blog-post.html". I used the net/url library to pull the source code of Fred's blog and the following regexp-match procedure to pull the latest entry from the blog:

```racket
#rx"((?=<strong>Meeting).*?(?<=</ul>))
```
The way that this regex works is it just looks for everything inside the given text that matches the first set of keys, which in this case is "Meeting" and then matches everything until and including "".

This is what the created html output looks like: Image of HTML output

## How to Prepare and Submit this assignment

1. To start, [**fork** this repository][forking]. 
  2. (This assignment is just one README.md file, so you can edit it right in github)
1. Modify the README.md file and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your report.
1. Add your racket file to the repository. 
1. Ensure your changes (report in md file, and added rkt file) are committed to your forked repository.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
