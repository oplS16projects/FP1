## My Library: plot
My name: Willis Hand

I really wanted to do something that had a visual component, and being inspired by the other students work we were shown in class I decided to explore the plotting library. This library has several components, but the parts that I really focused on were the 2D and 3D plotting procedures. It also has support for saving plots as image files, which is really cool!

I started with the sample code from the racket website
'''
(plot (function sin (- pi) pi #:label "y = sin(x)"))
'''
