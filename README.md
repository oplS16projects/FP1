## My Library: (require 2htdp/image)
My name: Aliyu Zakari

I used the 2htdp/image. The library gives me the tools of making shapes, lines and polygons. I played around and used the following procedures; 

> (circle)
> (rectangle)
> (overlay/offset)
> (besides)
> (above)

In the program i created the following procedures

<procedure:chains>  

The procedure takes in one argument, then that argument is passed onto the overlay/offset procedure nested in the procedure. It will generate two of that object you passed in a chain form. You can nest the procedure to create more chains of chains.
