# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)
DUE Friday, March 11, 2016

Hi,

So for my first exploration, I decided to check out the Turtle graphics library because I remember I did something with a turtle graphics library as one of my first forays into programming back when I was much younger. 

I found the Racket documentation website very lacking for the Turtle library. I'm not completely sure what you can do with the Turtle library, besides using the procedures that the library gives you. 

My favorite graphic I wrote was with the following three procedures 

'(spyro-gyra)
(neato)
(graphics-bexam)'

This produced a very sweet looking image, which kept growing in small ways if I let it keep running
