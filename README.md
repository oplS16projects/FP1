My Library: (require net/url) with regular expressions

My name: Connor McLaughlin
 
Part 3:

I did my report on (require net/url) and regular expressions (imported from racket) to try and collect data from a website. The website I used was the stats page for the bruins. I ran into some trouble when using the regular expressions on the (get-pure-port) object. It seems that the regex-match modifies the pure-port object with the result from the call. This means that after I get the first stat number I search for I cannot get the second because it has been cropped out of the string. To get around this I saved the information with from the website as a string so I could make multiple calls to the stats. The problem is that this changed my regular expressions because the port->string function formats differently than my-port. To solve this issue I coppied the code from my-port into a string. If I plan on doing more with this I would have to change the regular expressions to match it directly from the source code.


Here is a more in-depth illistration of my problem:
```
#lang racket

(define myurl (string->url "http://bruins.nhl.com/club/stats.htm"))
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))

(regexp-match #rx"[0-9][0-9]" (car (regexp-match* #rx"P. Bergeron.*\"gp\">..<" myport)))
```
This first code would result in a list containing Bergeron's games played '(#68)

The issue is when you try to do two regexps on my port:

```
#lang racket

(define myurl (string->url "http://bruins.nhl.com/club/stats.htm"))
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))

(regexp-match #rx"[0-9][0-9]" (car (regexp-match* #rx"P. Bergeron.*\"gp\">..<" myport)))
(regexp-match* #rx"P. Bergeron.*\"gp\">..<" myport)
```
This would output 
'(#67)
'()

What is happening is the port is being modified by the first regexp-match call so it cant be match again.

After solving this issue I made a function that generates a list of stats for the bruins player Patrice Bergeron

```
(list "P. Bergeron"
      (car (regexp-match #rx"[0-9][0-9]" (car (regexp-match* #rx"P. Bergeron.*\"gp\">..<" myport))))
      (car (regexp-match #rx"[0-9][0-9]" (car (regexp-match #rx"goals\">..<" 
                                                 (car (regexp-match #rx"P. Bergeron.*\"goals\">..<" teststring))))))
      (car (regexp-match #rx"[0-9][0-9]" (car (regexp-match #rx"assts\">..<" 
                                                 (car (regexp-match #rx"P. Bergeron.*\"assts\">..<" teststring))))))
       (car (regexp-match #rx"[0-9][0-9]" (car (regexp-match #rx"plusminus\">..<" 
                                                 (car (regexp-match #rx"P. Bergeron.*\"plusminus\">..<" teststring)))))))
```
The first regex narrows it down to P.Bergeron (random code) "gp"<67> and the second regexp just gets the 68 this ouputs
'("P. Bergeron" #"67" "28" "33" "14")
