# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)
DUE Friday, March 11, 2016

#Part 2: Try a Library
In this exercise, you will play with at least one library provided by the Racket developers. You will have the opportunity to explore another library later.

Please choose libraries that you think you might be interested in using in your final project.

Start off at the Racket home page, http://racket-lang.org/, and then click on the Documentation link, taking you here: http://docs.racket-lang.org/.
 
There are lots of libraries. Play with one.
 
Your job is to explore one library and write up your results. Load the library and write some code to drive it around.

### The following libraries are not allowed for project explorations:
* games/cards
* racket/gui
* racket/draw 

You can still use these in your project, but you must explore different libraries for this assignment.

#Part 3: Write your Report
Write your report right in this file. Instructions are below.

This file IS your report for the assignment, including code and your story.

## My Library: (library name here)
My name:

> Sample

```
#lang racket

(require net/url)

(define myurl (string->url "http://www.cs.uml.edu/"))
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))
(display-pure-port myport)
```
Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:

* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. Yes, you need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be embedded into this md file. We should not have to click a link to see it. This is github, handling files is awesome and easy!

Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.

Ask questions publicly in the email group.
