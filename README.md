# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)

## My Library: Plot: Graph Plotting
My name: John Kuczynski. 

I installed the plot-gui-lib package, and then I used the functions in the library to draw a graph of a single function, x^2. 
Then, I created a graph with several functions. After that, I created several 3D graphs. 
Having accomplished that much, I created a function which accepted a 2D function, and would draw the graph of the function. Then, I created a function which accepted a 3d function, and would draw the graph of the function. 

![ScreenShot](picture1.jpg)
``` Racket
#lang racket
(plot (function (lambda (a) (* a a)) -3 3 #:label "x^2)"))

```

![ScreenShot](funct-picture.jpg)
``` Racket
#lang racket
(define (funct f)
  (plot (function f -3 3)))
  
>(funct (lambda (x) (* x x)))
```
This code accepts a function which should have one parameter, and draws a graph of the function. The x coordinates are from -3 to 3. 

![ScreenShot](graph3d.jpg)
```Racket
#lang racket
(define (funct3D f)
  (plot3d (surface3d f -4 4 -4 4)))
  
>(funct (lambda (x y) (+ (+ x x) (/ y 2))))
```
This code acepts a function which should have 2 parameters, and draws a graph of the function. The x coordinates are from -4 to 4, and the y coordinates are from -4 4.
