# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)
Library: "Slideshow: Figure and Presentation Tools"
Name: Chhun Kim

# What I did
I used the "Slideshow: Figure and Presentation Tools" to create a few powerpoint slides. This library allows developers to create sideshow, and there are so many features that we could actually create a simple presentation slide. For what I did was creating a few slide by using slideshow library. 
To add a new slide, we need to the slide function which is a build-in function.In the slide, we can edit the font and font-size of text, and adjusting the layout as well. Like Microsoft Powerpoint, we can also use the animation such 'next and 'alts which shows text or picture one at a time. 

# Code Highlights
```
#lang racket 

(require slideshow)

(slide
 #:title (bt "<***Welcome to UMass Lowell***>")

 (t "Final Project Exploration 1")
 (t "Slideshow: Figure and Presentation Tools")
 (t "Name: Chhun Kim")
 (t "")
 (t "<==>*<==>*<==>*<==>*<==>*<==>"))

(slide
 #:gap-size (* gap-size 2)
 (para #:align 'left
       (bit "<Content>"))
 'next
 (para #:align 'left
       "1. Creating Slides Presentation")
 'next

 'next

 'next

```

# Output 



Remember that this report must include:

* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. Yes, you need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be embedded into this md file. We should not have to click a link to see it. This is github, handling files is awesome and easy!

Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.

Ask questions publicly in the email group.

## How to Prepare and Submit this assignment

1. To start, [**fork** this repository][forking]. 
  2. (This assignment is just one README.md file, so you can edit it right in github)
1. Modify the README.md file and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your report.
1. Add your racket file to the repository. 
1. Ensure your changes (report in md file, and added rkt file) are committed to your forked repository.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
