;If an element is 'next, then a slide is generated containing only the preceding elements,
;and then the elements are re-processed without the 'next. Multiple 'next elements generate
;multiple slides.

;If an element is 'alts, then the next element must be a list of element lists. Each list
;up to the last one is appended to the elements before 'alts and the resulting list of
;elements is processed. The last lists is appended to the preceding elements along with
;the remaining elements (after the list of lists) and the result is re-processed.

;A 'nothing element is ignored (useful as a result of a branching expression).

;A 'next! element is like 'next, except that it is preserved when condensing
;(via the --condense flag).
